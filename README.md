- homemade vegan cheese recipe:
  take a container of soy yoghurt, drain it in a fined mesh cloth
  i use a reusable coffee filter over a bowl
  depending on the quality of your yoghurt it will drain more or less water (works with homemade yoghurt too!)
  put in the fridge overnight
  you can eat as is, or mix in salt pepper, fresh and/or dried herbs and/or spices, garlic and olive oil, etc!

great on pizza and bread or as a dip!

enjoy!
